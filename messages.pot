"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that occurs when pigment-producing "
"cells—known as melanocytes—mutate and become cancerous. Melanoma is the "
"most serious form of skin cancer and is the fifth most common cancer "
"among both men and women. Even though invasive melanoma accounts for only"
" about 1 percent of all skin cancers, it is responsible for the majority "
"of deaths from skin cancer. Melanoma is dangerous because it is more "
"likely to spread, or metastasize, than other skin cancers, such as basal "
"cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma."
